I was part of several research projects when I studied math. I was/am primarily interested in topology and algebraic invariants, but also did research on combinatorics and number theory.

## Research Projects
- In 2021, I studied knotted surfaces in dimension four with the [Polymath Jr. REU](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu). I wrote code to generate examples of knotted surfaces and understand their invariants.
- In 2020, I studied recurrence sequence and sum/difference sets at Williams College's [SMALL REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/). I looked at generalizations of the Fibonacci sequence to figure out whether they could express every natural number as a sum of sequence terms (this property is called [completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_sequence)).
