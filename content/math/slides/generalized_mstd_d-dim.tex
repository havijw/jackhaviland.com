\begin{frame}{Motivation}

We often care about the sumset /difference set of $A\subseteq \Z$.

\pause
\Bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Goldbach's Conjecture: $E\subseteq P+P$ 

\pause
\Bigskip

\item Fermat's Last Theorem: If $A_n$ is the set of positive $n$-th powers, then $(A_n+A_n)\cap A_n = \emptyset$ for all $n\geq 3$
\end{itemize}

\pause
\Bigskip

Natural question: What are the sizes of the sumsets/difference sets?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{History}

How big do we expect the sumset to be? How big do we expect the difference set to be?

\item $|A-A|=25$
%Difference Set:$\{-14,-12,-11,-10,-9,-8,-7,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,$ $1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,14\}$,\textbf{25 elements}

\begin{frame}{History}
%Nathanson: percentage of sets should go down to 0. MO showed positive percentage; Zhao showed bound

\alert{Martin-O'Bryant}: A positive percentage of sets $A \subset [0, n-1]$ are MSTD as $n \to \infty$.

\pause
\bigskip

\alert{Zhao}: The percentage approaches a limit and
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\#\{A\subseteq [0,n-1];\, A \text{ is sum-dominant}\}}{2^n}> 0.000428.$$

\begin{itemize}
\item Say $A\subseteq [0,n]$, then $x\in A+A$ if we can find $a_1,a_2\in A$ such that $a_1+a_2=x.$

\pause
\bigskip

\item The number of pairs in $[0,n]$ that sum to $x$ is large, except when $x$ is near $0$ or $2n$. 

\pause
\bigskip

\item With high probability, the middle will be full, but the fringes will be missing elements

\pause
\bigskip

\item As the fringes in the sumset and difference set are made by fringes in the original set, the trick is to control the fringes.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Definitions}

We generalize the idea of sumsets and difference sets: \pause

$$sA-dA \ = \ \underbrace{A+\cdots+A}_{\text{$s$ times}}- (\underbrace{A+\cdots+A}_{\text{$d$ times}}),  $$

$$a_1+\cdots + a_s - (a_{s+1}+\cdots +a_{s+d}) \in sA-dA.$$

\begin{itemize}
