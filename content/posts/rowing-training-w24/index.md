To create a training plan for the winter months where I can't row on the water, I've been reading a lot from Will Ruth's excellent [Rowing Strong](https://rowingstronger.com/) blog. He talks a lot about periodization, i.e., focusing on specific aspects of performance rather than trying to train all aspects at once. The rowing off-season is a great time to make general health improvements like getting stronger and improving cardiovascular endurance, while other training phases closer to competition can be used to develop rowing-specific skills.

In this spirit, this winter (or at least, the second half of this winter --- I spent the first half erging a lot) I will be focusing on strength training, something I have never consistently done. I believe this is the best thing I can do to set myself up for a good year of rowing. I've always been more of a technical-minded rower but lacked good erg scores and real power. This simply will not get me to achieve my goals, so I need to get stronger.

The primary goals of my program are:
- Build muscle mass
- Increase strength
- Maintain cardiovascular capacity
To this end, I will be spending 3 days per week lifting, and 1 day on long steady state. I have no serious plans for any erg tests, since I will mostly be focusing on weightlifting and while I do intend for this to improve my rowing, I will not be physically preprared to perform optimally on an erg test. I'd rather postpone testing to during the rowing season, when the results will be more meaningful.

I'm using [Strong](https://www.strong.app/) to plan and record my workouts. I also appreciate its built-in rest timer. My program is based on the [heavyweight off-season sample program](https://rowingstronger.com/2016/06/20/off-season-rowing-strength-training/) from Rowing Stronger, and is a simple weekly split:

| Mon | Deadlift/full body lift  |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| Tue | Steady state erg         |
| Wed | Rest                     |
| Thu | Squat/lower body lift    |
| Fri | OH Press/upper body lift |

Come April, I should have 3 days on the water per week, and I'm planning to supplement that with 2-4 additional workouts per week, or more if I can sustain it (finding training partners would help a lot!). Hopefully I'll continue to lift 2-3x per week, plus 1-3 erg workouts, eventually replacing erging with sculling for extra rowing time during the summer. I think I've got a solid plan for getting faster, so now it's time to execute and see what I can do!
